Based on the correct requirements, the following components were built incorrectly:

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **The current implementation assumes students are content creators** - This is incorrect
2. **Students should be consumers, not creators** - They enroll, study, and quiz
3. **Teachers/Instructors are the content creators** - They create courses and upload materials
4. **Role separation is critical** - Must implement proper access control

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Clarify Roles:**
   - Define Teacher vs Student permissions clearly
   - Implement role-based middleware

2. **Build Enrollment System:**
   - Available courses page
   - Enrollment functionality
   - Enrolled courses view

3. **Add Timer Modes:**
   - Pomodoro timer logic
   - Free time mode
   - Mode selection UI

4. **Restrict Access:**
   - Block students from course creation
   - Block students from content upload
   - Separate teacher interface

5. **Update Documentation:**
   - Correct user guide (already done)
   - Update implementation plan
   - Create teacher guide

---

**Summary:** The quiz-taking functionality is correct, but the course management was built for the wrong user role. Students should enroll in courses, not create them.
