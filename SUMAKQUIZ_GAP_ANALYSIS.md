**Project:** SumakQuiz - AI-Powered Study Platform  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel 11 + Livewire 3

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the capstone document and current codebase, the SumakQuiz implementation has **strong backend foundations** but is **missing critical student-facing interfaces and workflows**. The backend API, database schema, and AI integration are well-implemented, but the platform lacks the user interfaces needed for students to interact with the system as described in the capstone.

### Implementation Status: **~60% Complete**

- ✅ **Database Schema:** 95% complete
- ✅ **AI Integration:** 90% complete  
- ✅ **Admin Panel:** 100% complete (Filament)
- ⚠️ **Backend API:** 70% complete (missing quiz workflow endpoints)
- ❌ **Student UI:** 15% complete (only dashboard mock)
- ❌ **Quiz Taking Interface:** 0% complete
- ❌ **Quiz Regeneration Flow:** 0% complete
- ⚠️ **Adaptive Quiz Workflow:** 40% complete

- ❌ No workflow to trigger adaptive generation
- ❌ [`QuizController::start()`](app/Http/Controllers/QuizController.php:26) needs adaptive flag logic

**Implementation Needed:**
```php
// Check if student completed all initial subtopic quizzes
if ($subtopic->hasCompletedAllInitialQuizzes($userId)) {
    // Generate adaptive quiz based on theta
    $studentAbility = StudentAbility::where(...)->first();
    $adaptiveQuestions = $irtService->selectAdaptiveItems(
        $studentAbility->theta, 
        $availableItems, 
        20
    );
}
```

---

**Current State:** ❌ Mock data only  
**Controller Ready:** ✅ [`StudentDashboardController`](app/Http/Controllers/Student/StudentDashboardController.php:15) has real implementation  
**Livewire Component:** ❌ Using hardcoded mock data (lines 36-141)

**Fix Required:**
```php
// In app/Livewire/StudentDashboard.php
public function loadDashboardData() {
    $data = $this->dashboardController->getDashboardData();
    $this->courses = $data['courses'];
    $this->recentQuizzes = $data['recent_quizzes'];

## 16. CONCLUSION

**Current Status:** Strong backend, minimal frontend

**Critical Path:**
1. Quiz taking interface (1 week)
2. Course/document upload UI (3 days)
3. Dashboard real data (1 day)
4. Regeneration workflow (2 days)
5. Adaptive quiz trigger (2 days)

**Timeline:** 4 weeks to production-ready  
**Biggest Challenge:** Quiz interface with real-time timer  
**Biggest Asset:** Complete backend + AI integration already done

**Recommendation:** Focus on **Phase 1-2 first** (quiz taking), as this is the core user experience. All backend infrastructure is ready - we just need to expose it through student-facing UI.
